## Key Findings

- No clear linear relationship between GDP per capita and congestion levels.
- Mexico City presents the highest congestion levels.
- Urban congestion appears to be influenced by multiple structural factors.

## Strategic Implications

Investment in transport infrastructure should prioritize cities where congestion shows the strongest productivity impact.
