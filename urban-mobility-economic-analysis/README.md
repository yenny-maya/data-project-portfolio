# Urban Mobility and Economic Productivity in LATAM Cities

## Objective
This project analyzes the relationship between urban congestion indicators and economic productivity across major Latin American cities.

## Key Questions
- Do cities with higher GDP per capita experience lower congestion?
- Is there a consistent relationship between economic performance and mobility efficiency?

## Methodology
- Data cleaning and standardization
- Annual aggregation of traffic metrics
- Merging mobility and economic datasets
- Exploratory visualization and pattern detection

## Key Insight
No consistent linear relationship was found between GDP per capita and congestion levels. Urban congestion appears to be influenced by multiple structural factors beyond economic productivity alone.
